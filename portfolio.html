    <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        My Name is Jitendra Dhaduvai. I am 20 years old and was born and brought up in Hyderabad. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science.
        I am enthusiastic about exploring innovative solutions and collaborating on impactful projects.
        My strong interests lie in Python Development, Computer Vision, and Data-Driven Decision Making.
        <br><br>
        I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for AI and automation, and I try to solve real-world challenges.
        My goal is to achieve a successful career in Computer Science, and I am putting in my best efforts to reach it.

    <h3>Projects/Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
        I have worked on an AI-based Traffic Management System that utilizes real-time data to monitor and manage traffic flow.
        The project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and analyze traffic patterns, aiming to reduce congestion
        and improve overall road safety and efficiency.
        <br><br>
        We also focused on emergency vehicle prioritization, prioritizing vehicles like ambulances and fire trucks.
        This problem statement was chosen from the topics of SIH (Smart India Hackathon 2024).
        <br><br>
        For this project, I worked as a team with six members. The tech stack used was the complete MERN STACK, along with the PSO Algorithm (Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm),
        which is inspired by nature. Additionally, we used YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time emergency vehicle detection.
